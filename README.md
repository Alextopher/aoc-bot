A Discord bot that connects to the Advent of Code leaderboard API. It dishes out roles for achieving star milestones and unlocks daily discussion channels after challenge completion.

This bot is currently a **minimum viable product**. There is no usage document and that isn't a priority yet. Get in contact with me if you want to add this to another server, I might be able to host it for the time being.

This year (2023) will serve as a trail run. I will take what I learn and will try to tidy it up and launch it as a larger project in 2024.
